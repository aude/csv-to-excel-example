CSV to Excel example
====================

Examples for importing CSV to Excel.

Easy way
--------

It's possible to import CSV to Excel directly. This is probably the best way!

To try this, just open `regneark.xlsx` and then experiment or Google your way
until you know how to import the `eksempeldata.csv` file in a way that works
for you.

Python way
----------

If you for some reason want more flexibility, or are a complete Excel noob like
me, you could import new CSV data to Excel using Python!

This way lets you have almost complete control of the import process, and makes
things like parsing dates or checking existing data possible.

It could also let you fetch data directly from other sources than CSV, if there
are things like a Python library or HTTP API available for that source.

Other ways
----------

There are probably other better ways, these are just two ideas :)
